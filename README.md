Used by HireIQ for rolling deploys
=====================================

This process does the rolling deploy, by pulling servers out of the ELB, updating them, and adding them back.

Updated to work with latest versions of botocore (at least as of 2015-09-04)


Much thanks to badger-meter for adding in ```custom_json``` support
